# Full-Stack Engineer Assignment: AI-Powered Food Ordering System

## Overview

Build an intelligent food ordering platform for a restaurant that leverages AI to help customers discover and order food through natural conversations. The system should understand customer preferences, dietary requirements, and contextual requests to provide personalized food recommendations.

## The Challenge

Create a **chat-based food ordering experience** where users interact with an intelligent agent to discover and order food. This is a conversational interface where customers chat with an AI agent that understands their needs, asks clarifying questions, and helps them find the perfect meal—just like talking to a knowledgeable salesperson at a restaurant.

## What We're Looking For

We're evaluating:
- **Product thinking & problem understanding**: How well you interpret the requirements and make thoughtful decisions about the user experience
- **Implementation**: Proper frontend and backend development with effective AI integration
- **AI chat experience**: The quality of the conversational interface, especially the **dynamic UI capabilities**—how the agent generates rich, interactive UI components (like food cards with images) instead of just text responses

## Core Requirements

### 1. Conversational Interface
Build a chat-based interface where users can:
- Ask questions about food options (e.g., "What vegetarian options do you have?")
- Request specific dietary requirements (e.g., "I need something high in protein, low in carbs")
- Make complex queries (e.g., "I need chicken-based lunch with a salad and juice")
- Add items to cart conversationally (e.g., "Add two large pizzas to my cart")

### 2. Dynamic UI Components
The chat interface should display **rich, interactive UI elements**, not just text responses. Here are examples of what you could build (you have the freedom to choose which ones to implement):
- **Food cards** with images, descriptions, nutritional info, and pricing
- **Multiple item displays** when showing recommendations
- **Add to cart buttons** directly on food cards with quantity selectors
- **Cart summary** components
- **Order form** for checkout

The key is creating a visual, interactive experience within the chat rather than plain text responses.

### 3. Agent Intelligence and Interaction
The agent should effectively solve user problems through intelligent, multi-turn conversations:
- Ask follow-up questions when user requests are ambiguous or unclear
- Understand context from previous messages in the conversation
- Act like a helpful salesperson in a restaurant—not just one question, one response, but a natural back-and-forth dialogue
- **Example**: If a user asks for "pizza" and there are multiple options, the agent should ask clarifying questions about size, toppings, etc., then recommend based on the user's preferences

### 4. Cart & Checkout
- Users can add items via UI buttons or conversational commands
- Maintain cart state throughout the session
- Implement a checkout flow with a delivery form
- Payment method: Cash on Delivery (no payment gateway integration needed)

### 5. Data Source
You'll receive a markdown file containing 100+ food items with:
- Food name and description
- Images
- Detailed preparation information
- Ingredients list
- Nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, etc.)
- Pricing (including size variants where applicable)
- Category/type

Use this data to power your semantic search and recommendations. You're free to:
- Use any LLM or AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Implement semantic search/embeddings
- Use assistants APIs, RAG, or other agentic patterns

## Example Interactions

**Scenario 1:**
```
User: "I need something for lunch, chicken-based, high protein, low carb"

Agent: [Shows 3 chicken options as food cards with nutritional info]
       "Here are our best high-protein, low-carb chicken options. 
       Would you like to add any sides or drinks?"

User: "Yes, I'd like a salad and juice with that"

Agent: [Shows salad and juice options as cards]
       "Great choices! Here are salads and fresh juices that pair well. 
       Which ones would you like?"

User: "Add the Grilled Chicken Breast, Caesar Salad, and Orange Juice to my cart"

Agent: "Perfect! I've added:
       • Grilled Chicken Breast - ₹399
       • Caesar Salad - ₹249  
       • Fresh Orange Juice - ₹99
       
       Total: ₹747
       
       Would you like to checkout or continue browsing?"
```

**Scenario 2:**
```
User: "Add a large pizza to my cart"

Agent: "We have several large pizzas! Here are our options:"
       [Shows pizza cards: Margherita, Pepperoni, BBQ Chicken, Veggie Supreme]
       "Which one sounds good to you?"

User: "What's in the BBQ Chicken pizza?"

Agent: "Our BBQ Chicken Pizza has:
       • Grilled chicken
       • BBQ sauce base
       • Red onions
       • Cilantro
       • Mozzarella cheese
       
       It's one of our most popular items! Want to add it?"

User: "Yes, add two of those"

Agent: "Added 2 Large BBQ Chicken Pizzas to your cart! (₹549 each)
       
       Anything else you'd like?"
```

**Scenario 3:**
```
User: "What vegetarian options do you have?"

Agent: [Shows 6-8 vegetarian items as food cards across different categories]
       "We have lots of vegetarian options! I'm showing you our:
       • Salads
       • Veggie pizzas
       • Pasta dishes
       • Veggie burgers
       
       What type of meal are you in the mood for?"

User: "I don't like any of these. Do you have something with paneer?"

Agent: [Shows paneer-based items]
       "Absolutely! Here are our paneer dishes. The Paneer Tikka and 
       Palak Paneer are customer favorites. Would either of these work?"

User: "The Palak Paneer looks good. Can I get it with naan?"

Agent: "Great choice! I can add both to your cart:
       • Palak Paneer - ₹379
       • Garlic Naan - ₹69
       
       Should I add these?"

User: "Yes please"

Agent: "Done! Added to your cart. Ready to checkout?"
```

## Technical Considerations

### Must Have
- **Frontend**: React or Next.js
- **Backend**: Next.js, Node.js, Python, or Tanstack Start (you can use fullstack frameworks that combine both)
- AI/LLM integration for conversation handling
- Cart state management
- **Docker setup**: Complete Docker configuration for easy local testing

### Nice to Have
- User authentication (simple is fine)
- Polished, elegant UI
- Traditional e-commerce browse view alongside chat

### Freedom to Choose
- Come up with your own restaurant name and branding
