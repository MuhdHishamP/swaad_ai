      "description": "Butter Chicken, or Murgh Makhani, is perhaps the most beloved Indian dish to have crossed international borders. Tender chicken pieces are marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked in a tandoor before being drenched in a luxurious tomato-based gravy enriched with butter, cream, and a touch of kasuri methi. The sauce strikes a perfect balance between tangy and creamy, with subtle warmth from garam masala rather than aggressive heat. It pairs exceptionally well with naan or basmati rice, and many consider it the ideal introduction to North Indian cuisine for those unfamiliar with Indian flavors. The dish originated in Delhi in the 1950s when leftover tandoori chicken was repurposed into a rich gravy. Today, every restaurant has its own interpretation—some favor sweeter notes, others a more pronounced tomato tang. Our version uses a secret blend of over fifteen spices and slow-cooked tomatoes for a depth that keeps guests coming back.",

The lentils are simmered in tomatoes, cream, and butter, with whole spices infusing the dish as it cooks. The result is deeply comforting, with earthy undertones from the black lentils and a richness that borders on indulgent. A spoonful over steaming rice or with hot roti is pure satisfaction. Historically, this dish was prepared overnight in village kitchens, with the dal left to simmer in clay ovens. Modern kitchens replicate that patience with extended cooking times. We finish ours with a generous swirl of cream and a sprinkling of fresh coriander. It's naturally vegetarian, gluten-free, and surprisingly nutritious despite its decadent texture.",

This dish appeals to both health-conscious diners and those seeking comfort food. The paneer absorbs the flavors beautifully while providing protein. We use young, tender spinach for a smoother purée and blanch it quickly to preserve the bright green color.

The layers are assembled with fried onions, mint, and saffron-infused milk, then sealed and cooked on dum (slow steam) to create a dish where every component has contributed to the whole. Regional variations abound—Hyderabadi, Kolkata, Lucknowi—each with distinct characteristics. Our version draws from the Hyderabadi tradition with its balance of heat and aroma.

The chicken is cooked in a clay tandoor at temperatures exceeding 400°C, which creates a charred exterior while keeping the meat remarkably juicy. The yogurt in the marinade acts as a tenderizer, while the spices form a crust that's both aromatic and slightly smoky. The dish was popularized globally by Moti Mahal in Delhi, but its roots go back centuries to the Mughal courts. We use free-range chicken and a 24-hour marination for authentic texture.

Tender lamb is braised in a stunning red gravy colored by Kashmiri chilies and an array of aromatic spices. The dish gets its name from \"rogan\" (oil) and \"josh\" (heat)—referring to the crimson oil that rises to the surface. Fennel, ginger, and asafoetida add layers of flavor that distinguish it from other North Indian curries. The slow braising process is essential—the lamb should fall apart at the touch of a fork while the gravy has concentrated into something profoundly flavorful.

The chicken is cooked until tender, then tossed with the vegetables and masala at high heat, creating a dish that's fragrant, slightly smoky, and texturally diverse. The bell peppers should still have a bit of crunch; the onions should be caramelized at the edges. The kadai masala—typically roasted coriander seeds, dried red chilies, and sometimes fennel—is ground coarsely rather than into a fine powder, giving the dish a rustic texture and pronounced spice flavor. It's not as creamy as butter chicken or as saucy as a standard curry; it's somewhere in between, with just enough gravy to coat the chicken and vegetables.

      "description": "Jalebi is the pretzel-shaped sweet that's both festive and everyday—a fermented batter of maida and yogurt is piped into hot oil in spiral shapes, deep-fried until crisp, then soaked in sugar syrup. The result is sticky, sweet, and has a slight tang from the fermentation. The exterior is crispy when fresh; the interior absorbs the syrup. Eaten hot, it's one of India's most beloved sweets, often paired with milk or rabri for breakfast or as a dessert. The art of making jalebi lies in the consistency of the batter and the skill of piping it into the oil—the spirals should be even and the frying should be just right so they're crisp but not hard. The sugar syrup must be the right temperature; too hot and the jalebi becomes soggy, too cool and it won't absorb enough. We make ours fresh, so they arrive warm and crispy. They're vegetarian, gluten-full, and unapologetically sweet. A celebration in every bite.",

The rose water in the syrup adds a floral note that distinguishes them from other Indian sweets. A cardamom pod or two in the syrup adds warmth and complexity. These are perhaps the most popular Indian sweet, served at weddings, festivals, and restaurants. The key is in the dough—it must be soft enough to absorb the syrup but firm enough to hold its shape. We make ours with a perfect ratio of khoya to flour, fry them at the right temperature, and let them soak until they've absorbed the flavors. Served warm or at room temperature, they're vegetarian, indulgent, and the perfect ending to an Indian meal. Two pieces per serving is standard.",

      "description": "Nihari is a slow-cooked beef or mutton stew that originated in the Mughal courts and became the breakfast of kings—and later, of everyone in Old Delhi. The name comes from \"nahar\" (morning), as it was traditionally eaten at dawn. The meat is simmered for hours with bone marrow (magaz), creating a gravy that's thick, gelatinous, and profoundly flavorful. The spice blend includes everything from basic garam masala to more exotic ingredients like rose and vetiver. We start our nihari the night before, allowing the flavors to develop fully. The result is meat that falls apart at the touch and a gravy that coats the spoon. Served with khameeri roti (leavened bread) and garnished with ginger, cilantro, and green chilies, it's a dish that demands commitment—you'll be thinking about it for hours after. Not for the diet-conscious, but utterly worth it.",

Lentils are often added, and the whole thing is pounded and stirred until it achieves a unique texture that's neither soup nor solid. The spices—including saffron, rose, and cardamom—add complexity to what could otherwise be monotone. The dish has Persian roots (harissa) and was adapted in Hyderabad, where it became synonymous with Ramadan. We make ours over 8-10 hours, the traditional way. The garnish of fried onions, lemon, and cilantro is essential—it cuts through the richness. Served with naan or by itself, it's incredibly filling. One bowl is a meal; two is an experience.",

The meat is typically marinated in yogurt, garlic, and a blend of Middle Eastern spices before being layered with fat for juiciness. Wrapped in a soft flatbread with tahini, pickles, and fresh vegetables, it's a handheld meal that's both satisfying and portable. The vertical cooking method ensures each slice has a mix of crisp, caramelized edges and tender interior. We offer both chicken and mutton shawarma, with the option to add fries inside the wrap—a popular Indian adaptation. The garlic sauce is house-made, and we're generous with it. For those avoiding bread, we offer shawarma plates with rice or on a bed of lettuce. The key to great shawarma is the marinade and the quality of meat; we use thigh meat for chicken (more flavorful than breast) and well-trimmed mutton.",

The steam from the chicken flavors the rice, while the rice absorbs the rendered fat. The result is incredibly tender meat and fragrant rice that needs nothing more than a squeeze of lemon. The dish is traditionally cooked in a tandoor-like pit, but home and restaurant versions adapt the technique. We use basmati rice and our own Mandi spice blend. The chicken falls off the bone, and the rice has a subtle smokiness. Served with a simple salad and that addictive Mandi sauce (often tamarind-based), it's comfort food from the Arabian Peninsula.

For paneer lovers who want something with more punch. The vegetables should retain some bite—we cook them quickly at high heat. The tomato gravy is thicker than other paneer preparations, and the coarsely ground spices are visible, adding to the rustic appeal. We sometimes add a touch of cream to balance the heat, but it's optional. Served with naan or roti, it's a satisfying vegetarian main that's full of texture and flavor.",

It's vegetarian, relatively light (despite the fried elements), and the perfect beach snack—though we've seen it enjoyed everywhere. A squeeze of lemon at the end is essential. Mumbai on a plate.",
