## North Indian

### Butter Chicken

![Butter Chicken](images/butter_chicken.png)

**Description:** Butter Chicken, or Murgh Makhani, is perhaps the most beloved Indian dish to have crossed international borders. Tender chicken pieces are marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked in a tandoor before being drenched in a luxurious tomato-based gravy enriched with butter, cream, and a touch of kasuri methi. The sauce strikes a perfect balance between tangy and creamy, with subtle warmth from garam masala rather than aggressive heat. It pairs exceptionally well with naan or basmati rice, and many consider it the ideal introduction to North Indian cuisine for those unfamiliar with Indian flavors.

The dish originated in Delhi in the 1950s when leftover tandoori chicken was repurposed into a rich gravy. Today, every restaurant has its own interpretation—some favor sweeter notes, others a more pronounced tomato tang. Our version uses a secret blend of over fifteen spices and slow-cooked tomatoes for a depth that keeps guests coming back.

### Dal Makhani

![Dal Makhani](images/dal_makhani.png)

**Description:** Dal Makhani is the crown jewel of Punjabi lentil preparations—black urad dal and rajma beans slow-cooked for hours until they achieve a velvety, almost paste-like consistency. The lentils are simmered in tomatoes, cream, and butter, with whole spices infusing the dish as it cooks. The result is deeply comforting, with earthy undertones from the black lentils and a richness that borders on indulgent. A spoonful over steaming rice or with hot roti is pure satisfaction.

Historically, this dish was prepared overnight in village kitchens, with the dal left to simmer in clay ovens. Modern kitchens replicate that patience with extended cooking times. We finish ours with a generous swirl of cream and a sprinkling of fresh coriander. It's naturally vegetarian, gluten-free, and surprisingly nutritious despite its decadent texture.

### Paneer Tikka

![Paneer Tikka](images/paneer_tikka.png)

**Description:** Paneer Tikka breathes life into the humble cottage cheese through fire and spice. Cubes of paneer are marinated in a vibrant paste of yogurt, turmeric, red chili, lemon juice, and tandoori masala, then threaded onto skewers and charred in a tandoor. The high heat creates a smoky crust while keeping the interior impossibly soft. Served with mint chutney and a squeeze of lemon, it's a textural revelation—crisp edges giving way to creamy, melt-in-your-mouth cheese.

This dish has become a staple at every Indian celebration, from casual get-togethers to wedding feasts. The marinade can be customized—some prefer a hint of mustard, others a touch of cream for extra richness. Our version uses a 6-hour marination for maximum flavor penetration. It's perfect as an appetizer or alongside a heavier curry.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium
**Ingredients:** Paneer, yogurt, turmeric, red chili, tandoori masala, lemon, ginger-garlic paste

### Palak Paneer

![Palak Paneer](images/palak_paneer.png)

**Description:** Palak Paneer transforms nutrient-dense spinach into a luxurious vegetarian main. Fresh spinach is blanched, puréed, and cooked with spices into a vibrant green gravy that gently cradles cubes of paneer. The dish walks a fine line—the spinach provides earthiness and iron, while cream and butter add silkiness. A touch of garam masala and fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) add warmth without overwhelming the delicate vegetal notes.

This dish appeals to both health-conscious diners and those seeking comfort food. The paneer absorbs the flavors beautifully while providing protein. We use young, tender spinach for a smoother purée and blanch it quickly to preserve the bright green color. Traditionally served with naan or paratha, it's also excellent with jeera rice for a lighter meal.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild
**Ingredients:** Paneer, spinach, cream, butter, onions, tomatoes, garam masala, kasuri methi

### Chicken Biryani

![Chicken Biryani](images/chicken_biryani.png)
**Description:** Chicken Biryani is a celebration in a pot—layers of fragrant basmati rice and spiced chicken cooked together so that each grain absorbs the essence of the other. The rice is parboiled with whole spices—cardamom, cinnamon, cloves—while the chicken is marinated in yogurt and a complex biryani masala. The layers are assembled with fried onions, mint, and saffron-infused milk, then sealed and cooked on dum (slow steam) to create a dish where every component has contributed to the whole.

Regional variations abound—Hyderabadi, Kolkata, Lucknowi—each with distinct characteristics. Our version draws from the Hyderabadi tradition with its balance of heat and aroma. The telltale sign of a quality biryani is the orange-hued rice grains and the tender chicken that falls apart at the touch. Served with raita, it's a complete meal that demands your full attention.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Non-Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium-Hot
**Ingredients:** Basmati rice, chicken, yogurt, biryani masala, onions, saffron, mint, spices

### Tandoori Chicken

![Tandoori Chicken](images/tandoori_chicken.png)
**Description:** Tandoori Chicken is the original Indian grilled chicken—marinated in yogurt, lime, and a proprietary blend of spices including Kashmiri red chili for that signature crimson hue. The chicken is cooked in a clay tandoor at temperatures exceeding 400°C, which creates a charred exterior while keeping the meat remarkably juicy. The yogurt in the marinade acts as a tenderizer, while the spices form a crust that's both aromatic and slightly smoky.

The dish was popularized globally by Moti Mahal in Delhi, but its roots go back centuries to the Mughal courts. We use free-range chicken and a 24-hour marination for authentic texture. Served with sliced onions, lemon wedges, and mint chutney, it's a showstopper that appeals to spice lovers and mild-palate diners alike—the heat level can be adjusted in the marinade.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Non-Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium
**Ingredients:** Chicken, yogurt, tandoori masala, Kashmiri chili, lemon, ginger-garlic paste
**Calories:** 420 | **Protein:** 38g | **Carbs:** 8g | **Fat:** 28g
**Price:** ₹399 | **Serves:** 1

### Rogan Josh

![Rogan Josh](images/rogan_josh.png)
**Description:** Rogan Josh hails from Kashmir, where the cold climate demands dishes that warm from within. Tender lamb is braised in a stunning red gravy colored by Kashmiri chilies and an array of aromatic spices. The dish gets its name from "rogan" (oil) and "josh" (heat)—referring to the crimson oil that rises to the surface. Fennel, ginger, and asafoetida add layers of flavor that distinguish it from other North Indian curries.

The slow braising process is essential—the lamb should fall apart at the touch of a fork while the gravy has concentrated into something profoundly flavorful. We use goat meat as well for those who prefer a slightly gamier profile. Traditionally served with naan or steamed rice, it's a dish that rewards patience in both preparation and eating.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Non-Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium
**Ingredients:** Lamb, Kashmiri chilies, yogurt, fennel, ginger, garlic, spices
**Calories:** 520 | **Protein:** 35g | **Carbs:** 14g | **Fat:** 36g
**Price:** ₹459 | **Serves:** 1

### Chole Bhature

![Chole Bhature](images/chole_bhature.png)
**Description:** Chole Bhature is Delhi's answer to the perfect brunch—spiced chickpeas paired with deep-fried, fluffy bread that puffs up like a balloon. The chole is cooked with pomegranate seeds, tea leaves, and a complex masala until the chickpeas are soft but still hold their shape. The bhature is made from maida dough enriched with yogurt, rolled thin and deep-fried until it inflates into a golden, crisp-yet-soft pillow of carbohydrate heaven.

The combination is pure indulgence—the spiced chickpeas with their tangy, slightly sour gravy are scooped up with torn pieces of bhature. It's typically served with pickled onions and green chilies. This is not diet food; it's the kind of meal you order when you want to be gloriously full. A weekend breakfast favorite and a dish that defines North Indian comfort food.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium
**Ingredients:** Chickpeas, maida, yogurt, chole masala, pomegranate seeds, spices
**Calories:** 650 | **Protein:** 18g | **Carbs:** 88g | **Fat:** 26g
**Price:** ₹249 | **Serves:** 1

### Aloo Paratha

![Aloo Paratha](images/aloo_paratha.png)
**Description:** Aloo Paratha is the breakfast that fuels a nation—whole wheat flatbread stuffed with spiced mashed potatoes, rolled thin, and pan-fried with ghee until golden and crisp. The potato filling is seasoned with cumin, coriander, ginger, and green chilies, then encased in the dough and cooked on a tawa. Each bite offers crisp, buttery layers and a soft, flavorful filling. It's traditionally served with butter, yogurt, and pickle—a complete meal in itself.

This is the breakfast you grew up with if you're from North India—the kind of food that represents home and comfort. We make ours with attention to the layers and the seasoning of the filling. The paratha should be crisp outside but not hard, and the potato should be flavorful without being mushy. Vegetarian, filling, and utterly satisfying. Perfect with a cup of masala chai.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild
**Ingredients:** Whole wheat flour, potatoes, cumin, coriander, ginger, green chilies, ghee
**Calories:** 420 | **Protein:** 10g | **Carbs:** 58g | **Fat:** 16g
**Price:** ₹149 | **Serves:** 1

### Naan

![Naan](images/naan.png)
**Description:** Naan is the pillowy, tandoor-baked flatbread that has become synonymous with Indian dining worldwide. Made from maida (refined flour), yogurt, milk, and leavened with yeast, the dough is slapped onto the walls of a blazing hot tandoor where it cooks in minutes. The result is a soft, slightly chewy bread with characteristic charred spots and a hint of smokiness. One side is typically brushed with butter or ghee before serving.

The beauty of naan lies in its versatility—it's the perfect vehicle for rich curries, excellent on its own, and can be enhanced with garlic, butter, or stuffed with various fillings. We offer plain, butter, and garlic versions. The key is the tandoor's heat, which creates that signature texture that's impossible to replicate in a regular oven. Essential for mopping up every last bit of curry.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Neutral
**Ingredients:** Maida, yogurt, milk, yeast, butter
**Calories:** 260 | **Protein:** 8g | **Carbs:** 45g | **Fat:** 6g
**Price:** ₹49 | **Serves:** 1

### Kadai Chicken

![Kadai Chicken](images/kadai_chicken.png)
**Description:** Kadai Chicken takes its name from the wok-like vessel it's cooked in—a semi-dry preparation with bell peppers, onions, and a coarsely ground kadai masala. The chicken is cooked until tender, then tossed with the vegetables and masala at high heat, creating a dish that's fragrant, slightly smoky, and texturally diverse. The bell peppers should still have a bit of crunch; the onions should be caramelized at the edges.

The kadai masala—typically roasted coriander seeds, dried red chilies, and sometimes fennel—is ground coarsely rather than into a fine powder, giving the dish a rustic texture and pronounced spice flavor. It's not as creamy as butter chicken or as saucy as a standard curry; it's somewhere in between, with just enough gravy to coat the chicken and vegetables. Best enjoyed with naan or roti, it's a crowd-pleaser that balances heat with flavor.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Non-Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium
**Ingredients:** Chicken, bell peppers, onions, kadai masala, tomatoes, ginger
**Calories:** 420 | **Protein:** 34g | **Carbs:** 18g | **Fat:** 24g
**Price:** ₹389 | **Serves:** 1

### Rajma Chawal

![Rajma Chawal](images/rajma_chawal.png)
**Description:** Rajma Chawal is the soul food of North India—kidney beans simmered in a spiced tomato-onion gravy, served over steamed basmati rice. The rajma must be cooked until soft and creamy, absorbing the flavors of the masala while still holding their shape. The gravy should be thick enough to cling to the beans and the rice. This is the meal that defines comfort—simple, satisfying, and deeply nostalgic for anyone who grew up eating it.

The key is in the overnight soaking of the beans and the slow cooking that follows. We add a tempering of cumin and garlic at the end for extra aroma. Some prefer it slightly soupy; others like it thicker—we aim for a middle ground. Served with a dollop of ghee and perhaps some pickled onions, it's a complete, protein-rich meal that vegetarians and meat-eaters alike can appreciate. Sunday lunch in a bowl.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild-Medium
**Ingredients:** Kidney beans, tomatoes, onions, cumin, garam masala, ginger, garlic
**Calories:** 480 | **Protein:** 18g | **Carbs:** 72g | **Fat:** 12g
**Price:** ₹199 | **Serves:** 1

### Pani Puri

![Pani Puri](images/pani_puri.png)
**Description:** Pani Puri is the iconic Indian street snack—hollow, crispy puris filled with spiced potatoes and chickpeas, then dunked in tangy, spicy, mint-flavored water (pani). The experience is all about the burst of flavors and textures: the crunch of the puri, the softness of the filling, and the explosion of the pani in your mouth. It's meant to be eaten in one or two bites, creating a sensory overload that's utterly addictive.

The pani is the star here—a blend of mint, coriander, tamarind, black salt, cumin, and chilies, creating something that's simultaneously sweet, tangy, spicy, and refreshing. Some regions prefer their pani more tangy; others want heat. We offer both sweet and spicy versions. Traditionally sold by street vendors who expertly fill and serve them rapid-fire, pani puri has become an essential part of Indian food culture. Six pieces per serving is standard, though one round is rarely enough.

**Category:** North Indian / Street Food | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium
**Ingredients:** Puris, potatoes, chickpeas, mint, tamarind, spices
**Calories:** 240 (per 6 pieces) | **Protein:** 6g | **Carbs:** 42g | **Fat:** 6g
**Price:** ₹99 | **Serves:** 1 (6 pieces)

### Pav Bhaji

![Pav Bhaji](images/pav_bhaji.png)
**Description:** Pav Bhaji is Mumbai's gift to street food—a thick vegetable curry (bhaji) served with buttered, toasted bread rolls (pav). The bhaji is made by mashing a medley of vegetables—potatoes, tomatoes, peas, bell peppers, cauliflower—with pav bhaji masala, butter, and a generous amount of butter. The result is a rich, spiced mash that's both comforting and indulgent. The pav is slathered with butter and toasted on a griddle until crisp at the edges.

The dish originated as a quick lunch option for Mumbai's textile mill workers and has since become a beloved street food across India. The secret is in the pav bhaji masala—a blend that typically includes dried mango powder, red chilies, and aromatic spices. We finish ours with a pat of butter that melts into the hot bhaji, creating a pool of flavor. Served with chopped onions, lemon wedges, and perhaps more butter, it's carb-heavy, unapologetically rich, and utterly satisfying.

**Category:** North Indian / Street Food | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild-Medium
**Ingredients:** Mixed vegetables, pav bhaji masala, butter, pav bread, onions
**Calories:** 580 | **Protein:** 12g | **Carbs:** 72g | **Fat:** 26g
**Price:** ₹179 | **Serves:** 1

### Samosa

![Samosa](images/samosa.png)
**Description:** Samosa is the quintessential Indian snack—a triangular pastry filled with spiced potatoes and peas, deep-fried until golden and crisp. The outer shell is made from maida dough, rolled thin and folded into a cone shape before being filled and sealed. The filling is a mix of boiled potatoes, peas, and a masala blend that includes cumin, coriander, and sometimes a hint of ginger. The result is crispy, savory, and utterly addictive.

Samosas are ubiquitous in India—sold at street corners, train stations, and served at parties. The key to a great samosa is the contrast between the crispy exterior and the soft, flavorful filling. We serve ours hot with mint chutney and tamarind chutney. They're vegetarian, perfect for snacking, and the kind of food that transcends occasions—equally at home at a fancy gathering or a casual tea break. Two pieces per serving is standard, though ordering more is common.

**Category:** North Indian / Street Food | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild-Medium
**Ingredients:** Maida, potatoes, peas, cumin, coriander, spices

**Price:** ₹79 | **Serves:** 1 (2 pieces)

### Jalebi

![Jalebi](images/jalebi.png)
**Description:** Jalebi is the pretzel-shaped sweet that's both festive and everyday—a fermented batter of maida and yogurt is piped into hot oil in spiral shapes, deep-fried until crisp, then soaked in sugar syrup. The result is sticky, sweet, and has a slight tang from the fermentation. The exterior is crispy when fresh; the interior absorbs the syrup. Eaten hot, it's one of India's most beloved sweets, often paired with milk or rabri for breakfast or as a dessert.

The art of making jalebi lies in the consistency of the batter and the skill of piping it into the oil—the spirals should be even and the frying should be just right so they're crisp but not hard. The sugar syrup must be the right temperature; too hot and the jalebi becomes soggy, too cool and it won't absorb enough. We make ours fresh, so they arrive warm and crispy. They're vegetarian, gluten-full, and unapologetically sweet. A celebration in every bite.

### Gulab Jamun

![Gulab Jamun](images/gulab_jamun.png)
**Description:** Gulab Jamun are soft, spongy balls of milk solids (khoya) and flour, deep-fried until golden and then soaked in rose-scented sugar syrup. They emerge from the syrup swollen and sweet, with a texture that's simultaneously firm and melt-in-your-mouth. The rose water in the syrup adds a floral note that distinguishes them from other Indian sweets. A cardamom pod or two in the syrup adds warmth and complexity.

These are perhaps the most popular Indian sweet, served at weddings, festivals, and restaurants. The key is in the dough—it must be soft enough to absorb the syrup but firm enough to hold its shape. We make ours with a perfect ratio of khoya to flour, fry them at the right temperature, and let them soak until they've absorbed the flavors. Served warm or at room temperature, they're vegetarian, indulgent, and the perfect ending to an Indian meal. Two pieces per serving is standard.

**Category:** North Indian / Desserts | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Sweet
**Ingredients:** Khoya, flour, sugar syrup, rose water, cardamom
**Calories:** 320 (per 2 pieces) | **Protein:** 6g | **Carbs:** 52g | **Fat:** 10g

### Lassi

![Lassi](images/lassi.png)
**Description:** Lassi is North India's quintessential yogurt drink—cooling, refreshing, and endlessly customizable. The base is yogurt thinned with water and whisked until frothy. Sweet lassi adds sugar and sometimes rose water; salty lassi (chaas) includes cumin, mint, and a pinch of salt; mango lassi blends in seasonal mango pulp for a tropical twist. In the summer heat, there's nothing more restorative.

We use fresh, full-fat yogurt for creaminess and authentic flavor. The sweet version is our bestseller, but the salty lassi pairs beautifully with spicy food—the probiotics and electrolytes make it the perfect accompaniment to a heavy meal. Mango lassi is a crowd-pleaser, especially when made with Alphonso mangoes in season. All versions are vegetarian and gluten-free.

**Category:** Beverages | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Neutral
**Ingredients:** Yogurt, water, sugar/salt/mango, spices

## South Indian

### Dosa

![Dosa](images/dosa.png)
**Description:** The dosa is South India's most celebrated export—a thin, crisp crepe made from fermented rice and lentil batter. The fermentation process, which takes 12-24 hours, creates a tangy flavor and light, airy texture. Plain dosa is the minimalist version: golden, crisp, and perfect with chutneys and sambar. Masala dosa stuffs the center with spiced potatoes. Mysore dosa comes with a fiery red chutney spread on the inside before adding the potato filling. Each region has its own variation; we honor the tradition while ensuring consistency.

A well-made dosa should be crisp at the edges, slightly soft in the center, and have those characteristic golden-brown spots. We serve ours with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar—a lentil-based vegetable stew. It's naturally gluten-free, fermented (good for gut health), and surprisingly light despite its size. Breakfast, lunch, or a late-night snack—the dosa knows no time boundaries.

**Category:** South Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild (Plain) / Medium (Masala) / Hot (Mysore)
**Ingredients:** Rice, urad dal, potatoes (masala), spices
**Calories:** 280 (plain) | 380 (masala) | 400 (Mysore)
**Price:** ₹149 (plain) | ₹199 (masala) | ₹219 (Mysore) | **Serves:** 1

---

### Idli

![Idli](images/idli.png)
**Description:** Idli are steamed rice cakes—pillowy, soft, and remarkably light. The same fermented batter used for dosa is poured into special molds and steamed, resulting in a spongy texture that absorbs chutneys and sambar beautifully. They're often considered one of the healthiest Indian foods—steamed, not fried; fermented for digestibility; naturally gluten-free. A plate of idlis with sambar and chutney is the classic South Indian breakfast.

The key to great idlis is the batter—the rice-to-lentil ratio, fermentation time, and steaming technique all matter. Ours are fluffy and not at all dense. We offer mini idlis as well, perfect for children or as a lighter option. Idlis are also popular as a late-night snack in South India, proof that good food transcends mealtime conventions.

**Category:** South Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild
**Ingredients:** Rice, urad dal (fermented)
**Calories:** 220 (per 3 pieces) | **Protein:** 8g | **Carbs:** 42g | **Fat:** 1g
**Price:** ₹99 | **Serves:** 1 (3 pieces)

---

### Sambar

![Sambar](images/sambar.png)
**Description:** Sambar is the soul of South Indian cuisine—a tangy, tamarind-based lentil stew loaded with vegetables. Toor dal forms the base, while tamarind provides the signature sour note. Vegetables like drumsticks, okra, pumpkin, and carrots add variety and nutrition. The sambar powder—a blend of roasted lentils, coriander, dried chilies, and other spices—gives it depth and warmth. No South Indian meal is complete without it.

We make our sambar fresh throughout the day, adjusting the vegetables based on what's seasonal. The consistency can vary—some prefer it thicker, almost like a dal; others like it more brothy. We aim for a middle ground that works with both idli and rice. A tempering of mustard seeds, curry leaves, and dried red chili in ghee at the end adds the final aromatic punch.

**Category:** South Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild-Medium
**Ingredients:** Toor dal, tamarind, vegetables, sambar powder, curry leaves
**Calories:** 140 | **Protein:** 8g | **Carbs:** 22g | **Fat:** 2g
**Price:** ₹79 | **Serves:** 1 (side)

### Uttapam

![Uttapam](images/uttapam.png)
**Description:** Uttapam is often described as the South Indian pizza—a thicker, softer cousin of the dosa with toppings cooked right into the batter. Onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and cilantro are the classic toppings, pressed into the batter as it cooks on the griddle. The result is a pancake that's crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy within, with bursts of flavor from the toppings. It's more substantial than a dosa, making it a satisfying meal.

We offer plain uttapam as well as variations with different toppings—cheese for the indulgent, mixed vegetables for the health-conscious. The batter is the same as dosa and idli, so the fermentation benefits apply. Served with sambar and chutneys, it's a complete meal that appeals to both traditionalists and those new to South Indian food.

**Category:** South Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild
**Ingredients:** Rice, urad dal, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, green chilies

### Medu Vada

![Medu Vada](images/medu_vada.png)
**Description:** Medu Vada are crisp, ring-shaped fritters made from urad dal batter—the same dal used in idli and dosa, but here it's seasoned with ginger, pepper, curry leaves, and onions, then deep-fried. The exterior is golden and crisp; the interior is soft and fluffy. The donut shape isn't just aesthetic—it ensures even cooking. Served with sambar and coconut chutney, they're the perfect accompaniment to idli or a standalone snack.

The name means "soft fritter" in Tamil—soft on the inside, despite the crisp exterior. Achieving that texture requires skilled frying and the right batter consistency. We make ours fresh, so they're always warm and crisp. Traditionally a breakfast item, we've noticed they're equally popular in the evening with a cup of filter coffee.

**Category:** South Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild
**Ingredients:** Urad dal, ginger, pepper, curry leaves, onions

### Pongal

![Pongal](images/pongal.png)
**Description:** Pongal is a creamy rice and lentil dish that's both a festival name and a comfort food. Ven pongal (savory) is made with rice, moong dal, ghee, pepper, cumin, and curry leaves—simple ingredients that create something profoundly satisfying. The dish is traditionally made during the harvest festival Pongal, but it's too good to reserve for one day. Served with sambar, chutney, and perhaps a vadai, it's the ultimate South Indian comfort breakfast.

The key is the generous amount of ghee and the tempering of black pepper and cumin that cuts through the creaminess. The texture should be porridge-like—neither too dry nor too soupy. We finish ours with cashews fried in ghee for a touch of crunch. It's vegetarian, gluten-free, and surprisingly light despite the richness.

**Category:** South Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild

### Bisi Bele Bath

![Bisi Bele Bath](images/bisi_bele_bath.png)

Bisi Bele Bath
**Description:** Bisi Bele Bath translates to "hot lentil rice" in Kannada—a one-pot dish from Karnataka that combines rice, toor dal, tamarind, and a special spice blend (bisi bele bath powder) with an array of vegetables. The result is a hearty, tangy, spicy rice dish that's a complete meal in itself. Some add ghee and papad on the side; purists insist it needs nothing. It's the kind of dish that improves with time—leftovers are often even better.

The spice blend is what makes it unique—typically including cinnamon, cloves, coconut, and a host of other ingredients. We make ours in small batches to ensure freshness. The vegetables vary by season, but we always include essentials like drumsticks and carrots. It's vegetarian, filling, and perfect for those who want a flavorful rice dish without the heaviness of biryani.

**Category:** South Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium
**Ingredients:** Rice, toor dal, tamarind, bisi bele bath powder, vegetables

### Kerala Fish Curry

![Kerala Fish Curry](images/kerala_fish_curry.png)
**Description:** Kerala Fish Curry captures the essence of the Malabar coast—tender fish pieces in a coconut-based gravy with the tang of kodampuli (Malabar tamarind) and the warmth of spices. The gravy is typically made with coconut milk and a paste of roasted spices, creating something that's creamy, tangy, and complex. Traditionally made in clay pots, the dish has variations using different fish—pomfret, kingfish, or the humble sardine.

We use locally sourced fish when possible and our gravy balances the traditional tartness with approachability. The curry leaves and mustard seeds in the tempering add the final South Indian touch. Served with steamed rice or appam (rice hoppers), it's a taste of Kerala's maritime heritage. The curry improves overnight as the flavors meld—if you have leftovers, consider yourself lucky.

### Filter Coffee

![Filter Coffee](images/filter_coffee.png)
**Description:** South Indian Filter Coffee is an institution—strong, sweet, and served in a traditional dabara and tumbler set. The coffee is made using a metal filter that drips boiling water through a mix of chicory and coffee powder (typically 80% coffee, 20% chicory). The resulting decoction is mixed with hot milk and sugar, then poured back and forth between the dabara and tumbler to create the perfect froth. The chicory adds body and a slight bitterness that coffee purists have come to love.

It's typically enjoyed after a South Indian meal, though many start their day with it. The "meter coffee"—poured from a height to aerate—is a skill that takes practice. We serve ours the traditional way, and the experience is as much about the ritual as the taste. One cup is rarely enough; the South Indian minimum seems to be two.

### Appam

![Appam](images/appam.png)

Appam
**Description:** Appam are lace-edged rice hoppers from Kerala—bowl-shaped pancakes made from fermented rice batter with a soft, thick center and delicate, crisp edges. The fermentation creates a slight tang, and the unique shape makes them perfect for holding curries. They're typically served with stew (vegetable or chicken) or kadala curry (chickpea), and the combination is one of Kerala's greatest contributions to Indian cuisine.

We make our appam in traditional appam pans, which give them the characteristic shape. The center should be soft and pillowy; the edges should be like lace. They're gluten-free, naturally fermented, and lighter than they look. For those new to South Indian food, appam with stew is an excellent introduction—mild, comforting, and utterly satisfying.

### Upma

![Upma](images/upma.png)

Upma
**Description:** Upma is semolina (rava) cooked with vegetables and tempered with mustard seeds, curry leaves, and lentils—a savory porridge that's a South Indian breakfast staple. The texture can vary from soft and creamy to dry and granular; we prefer something in between. Onions, carrots, and peas are common additions. A squeeze of lemon at the end brightens everything. It's quick to make, filling, and surprisingly versatile.

We offer plain upma as well as variations with vegetables. It's often served inside pesarattu or alongside idli. The tempering is crucial—the mustard seeds popping in oil, the curry leaves releasing their aroma. It's vegetarian, gluten-free (when made with rice rava), and the kind of dish that comforts without overwhelming. A humble star.

### Chicken 65

![Chicken 65](images/chicken_65.png)

Chicken 65
**Description:** Chicken 65 is the legendary deep-fried chicken from South India—its name's origin is disputed (perhaps the year 1965, or the 65th item on a menu, or 65 spices), but its popularity is undeniable. Chicken pieces are marinated in a red, spicy paste, then deep-fried until crisp. The result is fiery, addictive, and impossible to stop eating. Often served with onion and lemon, it's a bar snack that has transcended its origins.

We marinate our chicken for several hours in a blend that includes red chili, ginger, garlic, and curry leaves. The frying is done at high heat for maximum crispness. It's not for the faint of heart—the spice level is significant. But for chili lovers, it's a must-order. Vegetarians can try our Paneer 65, which uses the same treatment. One of India's most beloved fried chicken preparations.

## Mughlai

### Chicken Mughlai

![Chicken Mughlai](images/chicken_mughlai.png)

Chicken Mughlai
**Description:** Chicken Mughlai represents the zenith of Indo-Persian cuisine—chicken braised in a rich gravy redolent with almonds, cashews, cream, and a complex blend of spices that includes saffron and rose water. The Mughal emperors brought Persian culinary traditions to India, and this dish exemplifies the fusion. The gravy is thick, luxurious, and aromatic—nothing like the tomato-based North Indian curries. Each bite offers layers of flavor that reveal themselves slowly.

We use a blend of yogurt and cream for the base, with a paste of soaked nuts providing body and richness. The saffron is added at the end, both for color and its distinctive aroma. Served with naan or biryani, it's a dish fit for royalty—which, historically, it was. It's richer than butter chicken but less heavy than one might expect; the spices provide balance.

### Mutton Korma

![Mutton Korma](images/mutton_korma.png)

Mutton Korma
**Description:** Mutton Korma is the Mughlai answer to slow-cooked perfection—tender mutton in a mild, nutty gravy that showcases technique over heat. The word "korma" comes from the Turkish "kavurma" (to braise), and that's exactly what happens. The meat is browned, then braised in yogurt, cream, and a paste of nuts and aromatics. The result is extraordinarily tender meat in a gravy that's rich without being heavy.

Unlike many Indian curries, korma doesn't rely on tomatoes or heavy spicing. The flavor comes from the nuts, the slow cooking, and a careful balance of spices. We use goat meat (mutton in Indian context often means goat) for its flavor and texture. Served with naan or jeera rice, it's a dish for those who appreciate subtlety. The garnish of fried onions and fresh coriander adds texture and freshness.

### Nihari

![Nihari](images/nihari.png)
**Description:** Nihari is a slow-cooked beef or mutton stew that originated in the Mughal courts and became the breakfast of kings—and later, of everyone in Old Delhi. The name comes from "nahar" (morning), as it was traditionally eaten at dawn. The meat is simmered for hours with bone marrow (magaz), creating a gravy that's thick, gelatinous, and profoundly flavorful. The spice blend includes everything from basic garam masala to more exotic ingredients like rose and vetiver.

We start our nihari the night before, allowing the flavors to develop fully. The result is meat that falls apart at the touch and a gravy that coats the spoon. Served with khameeri roti (leavened bread) and garnished with ginger, cilantro, and green chilies, it's a dish that demands commitment—you'll be thinking about it for hours after. Not for the diet-conscious, but utterly worth it.

### Haleem

![Haleem](images/haleem.png)
**Description:** Haleem is a labor of love—a thick, porridge-like dish made by slow-cooking wheat, barley, and meat (usually mutton or beef) for hours until everything breaks down into a cohesive, velvety mass. Lentils are often added, and the whole thing is pounded and stirred until it achieves a unique texture that's neither soup nor solid. The spices—including saffron, rose, and cardamom—add complexity to what could otherwise be monotone.

The dish has Persian roots (harissa) and was adapted in Hyderabad, where it became synonymous with Ramadan. We make ours over 8-10 hours, the traditional way. The garnish of fried onions, lemon, and cilantro is essential—it cuts through the richness. Served with naan or by itself, it's incredibly filling. One bowl is a meal; two is an experience.

## Arabic / Middle Eastern

### Shawarma

![Shawarma](images/shawarma.png)
**Description:** Shawarma has become a street food phenomenon in India—marinated meat (chicken or lamb) stacked on a vertical rotisserie and slow-roasted as thin slices are shaved off. The meat is typically marinated in yogurt, garlic, and a blend of Middle Eastern spices before being layered with fat for juiciness. Wrapped in a soft flatbread with tahini, pickles, and fresh vegetables, it's a handheld meal that's both satisfying and portable. The vertical cooking method ensures each slice has a mix of crisp, caramelized edges and tender interior.

We offer both chicken and mutton shawarma, with the option to add fries inside the wrap—a popular Indian adaptation. The garlic sauce is house-made, and we're generous with it. For those avoiding bread, we offer shawarma plates with rice or on a bed of lettuce. The key to great shawarma is the marinade and the quality of meat; we use thigh meat for chicken (more flavorful than breast) and well-trimmed mutton.

### Falafel

![Falafel](images/falafel.png)
**Description:** Falafel are crisp, golden balls of ground chickpeas (or fava beans, depending on region) seasoned with herbs and spices, then deep-fried. The exterior is delightfully crunchy; the interior is soft and herbaceous. Originally from Egypt, falafel has spread across the Middle East and now enjoys immense popularity in India. Served in a pita with tahini, salads, and pickles, or as part of a mezze platter, they're a vegetarian staple that even meat-lovers enjoy.

We make our falafel from scratch using soaked (not canned) chickpeas for the best texture. Cilantro, parsley, cumin, and garlic feature prominently in our blend. The balls are fried to order so they're always crisp. We offer falafel wraps and platters—the platter includes hummus, tabbouleh, and pita for a complete Middle Eastern experience. Gluten-free when eaten without pita, and packed with protein.

### Hummus

![Hummus](images/hummus.png)
**Description:** Hummus is the creamy, dreamy dip that has conquered the world—chickpeas blended with tahini (sesame paste), lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil into a velvety spread. The simplicity belies the skill required; the balance of tahini to chickpeas, the amount of lemon, and the texture (smooth vs. slightly chunky) are all matters of preference and tradition. We've found our sweet spot: smooth enough to spread, substantial enough to feel like food.

We serve our hummus with warm pita, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of sumac or paprika. It's also available as part of our mezze platter. For variety, we offer variations with roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, or extra tahini. Hummus is naturally vegan, gluten-free (when eaten with vegetables), and surprisingly nutritious. It's the kind of dish that seems simple until you try to make it perfectly.

### Chicken Mandi

![Chicken Mandi](images/chicken_mandi.png)

Chicken Mandi
**Description:** Chicken Mandi is a Yemeni dish that has gained fierce popularity in India—especially in Hyderabad and other Muslim-majority areas. Whole chicken or large pieces are marinated with Mandi spices (a blend that often includes cardamom, cloves, and black lime), then slow-cooked over rice in a sealed pot. The steam from the chicken flavors the rice, while the rice absorbs the rendered fat. The result is incredibly tender meat and fragrant rice that needs nothing more than a squeeze of lemon.

The dish is traditionally cooked in a tandoor-like pit, but home and restaurant versions adapt the technique. We use basmati rice and our own Mandi spice blend. The chicken falls off the bone, and the rice has a subtle smokiness. Served with a simple salad and that addictive Mandi sauce (often tamarind-based), it's comfort food from the Arabian Peninsula. Perfect for sharing, though we won't judge if you keep it to yourself.

### Baklava

![Baklava](images/baklava.png)
**Description:** Baklava is the jewel of Middle Eastern sweets—layers of paper-thin phyllo pastry filled with chopped nuts (typically pistachios or walnuts) and held together with syrup or honey. The result is simultaneously crisp and chewy, nutty and sweet. Each region has its variation—Turkish baklava might use pistachios; Greek might use walnuts and honey; Arab versions might add rose water or orange blossom. We offer a selection that honors this diversity.

Our baklava is made in-house, which means we control the syrup level—enough for sweetness and moisture, not so much that it's cloying. We use a mix of pistachios and almonds for complexity. Served at room temperature, it pairs beautifully with Turkish coffee or mint tea. It's rich—a small piece goes a long way. Perfect for sharing, if you're feeling generous.

### Grilled Chicken Breast

![Grilled Chicken Breast](images/grilled_chicken_breast.png)

Grilled Chicken Breast
**Description:** Grilled Chicken Breast represents the clean-eating ideal—a lean, protein-packed cut seasoned simply and cooked to juicy perfection. We use skinless, boneless chicken breasts marinated in olive oil, lemon, garlic, and fresh herbs before grilling. The result is tender meat with appealing grill marks and a subtle char. No heavy sauces, no complicated preparations—just quality chicken treated with respect. Perfect for those watching their carb intake or seeking a lighter option.

We cook to medium (slightly pink in the center) unless you prefer otherwise. The simplicity means the quality of the chicken matters enormously—we source from trusted suppliers. Served with your choice of sides—steamed vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad—it's a meal that satisfies without weighing you down. Pairs well with a light white wine or fresh juice.

### Fish and Chips

![Fish and Chips](images/fish_and_chips.png)

Fish and Chips
**Description:** Fish and Chips brings British pub fare to the Indian table—crisp-battered fish served with thick-cut fries and tartar sauce. We use a light, beer-battered coating that fries up golden and shatteringly crisp while keeping the fish inside moist and flaky. The fish is typically cod or basa—mild, flaky white fish that doesn't fight the batter. The chips are double-fried for that perfect exterior crispness and fluffy interior.

Lemon wedges and tartar sauce are essential accompaniments; mushy peas for the purists. We've adapted the dish for Indian palates—the batter isn't overly heavy, and we offer a spicy mayo option for those who want a kick. It's comfort food at its finest—greasy in the best way, satisfying in every bite. Best consumed immediately; it doesn't travel well.

### Beef Steak

![Beef Steak](images/beef_steak.png)

Beef Steak
**Description:** Beef Steak is the Continental standard—a quality cut of beef, seasoned and cooked to your preference. We offer ribeye for marbling and flavor, or sirloin for a leaner option. The meat is brought to room temperature before cooking, seasoned simply with salt and pepper, and seared to develop a crust while maintaining the desired internal temperature. We serve it with a red wine reduction or peppercorn sauce, plus your choice of sides.

The quality of the beef is paramount—we use grain-finished beef for consistent flavor and tenderness. Doneness is entirely your choice; we recommend medium-rare for the best balance of flavor and texture. The dish appeals to those seeking something familiar yet special—a classic executed well. Pairs with a robust red wine or a cold beer.

### Grilled Fish

![Grilled Fish](images/grilled_fish.png)

Grilled Fish
**Description:** Grilled Fish is the light, clean option for seafood lovers—a fillet of fish (we use basa, salmon, or pomfret depending on availability) seasoned with herbs, lemon, and olive oil, then grilled until just cooked through. The aim is to let the fish shine—no heavy sauces, no complicated preparations. The grill adds a subtle smoky note; the lemon brightens everything. We serve it with steamed vegetables and perhaps a cilantro-lime rice.

The cooking time depends on the thickness of the fillet; we aim for flaky, moist fish that's never overcooked. Salmon gets a slightly different treatment—it can stand up to more robust flavors. The dish appeals to health-conscious diners and those who appreciate simplicity. Pairs well with white wine or a citrus-based mocktail.

### French Fries

![French Fries](images/french_fries.png)

French Fries
**Description:** French Fries are the universal side—potatoes cut into strips and deep-fried until golden and crisp. The exterior should be shatteringly crisp; the interior fluffy. We double-fry ours for the best results: first at a lower temperature to cook through, then at high heat to crisp. Served with ketchup, mayo, or our house sauces, they're the side that goes with everything.

We offer regular, seasoned (with spices), and truffle (for the indulgent) versions. The quality of the potato matters—we use varieties that fry well. They're vegetarian, and while not health food, they're one of life's pleasures. Perfect for sharing, though we've seen single diners polish off an entire order. No judgment.

### Caesar Salad

![Caesar Salad](images/caesar_salad.png)

Caesar Salad
**Description:** Caesar Salad is a study in contrasts—crisp romaine lettuce, crunchy croutons, parmesan shavings, and that addictive creamy dressing. The dressing, traditionally made with anchovies, egg yolk, garlic, lemon, and parmesan, coats each leaf without overwhelming. We offer both traditional and vegetarian versions (the latter uses capers for the umami note). Add grilled chicken or shrimp for a complete meal, or keep it as a refreshing starter.

The key to a great Caesar is the balance—the dressing should be bold but not acidic, creamy but not heavy. Our croutons are made in-house from day-old bread, seasoned and toasted until golden. The salad is assembled to order so the lettuce stays crisp. It's become a menu staple for good reason—approachable, satisfying, and endlessly customizable.

## Vegetarian Curries

### Malai Kofta

![Malai Kofta](images/malai_kofta.png)
**Description:** Malai Kofta is vegetarian decadence—soft dumplings of paneer and potato in a rich, creamy tomato-based gravy. The koftas are delicately spiced, sometimes studded with nuts and raisins, and either fried or baked before being submerged in the luxurious sauce. The "malai" (cream) in the name isn't exaggerating—this is one of the most indulgent vegetarian dishes in North Indian cuisine. Each kofta should be melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the gravy should coat every spoonful.

The dish is often reserved for special occasions, but we believe every day deserves a treat. We balance the richness with subtle spices—cardamom, cinnamon—that cut through the cream. Served with naan or jeera rice, it's a complete meal that satisfies even the most committed carnivores. The contrast between the soft koftas and the silky gravy is what makes it memorable.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild

### Paneer Butter Masala

![Paneer Butter Masala](images/paneer_butter_masala.png)
**Description:** Paneer Butter Masala is the vegetarian counterpart to Butter Chicken—cubes of paneer in the same luxurious tomato-cream gravy. The paneer absorbs the rich sauce beautifully while maintaining its structure. It's the dish that converts vegetarians to Indian food and satisfies those who prefer paneer over chicken. We use the same base gravy as our butter chicken, ensuring consistency for those who order both. Served with naan or rice, it's comfort in a bowl.

The key is getting the paneer right—it should be soft but not mushy, and the pieces should be uniform. We sometimes lightly fry the paneer before adding it to the gravy, which gives it a slight crust. The gravy should be creamy but not cloying, with a balance of tomato tang and butter richness. A sprinkle of kasuri methi at the end adds the finishing touch.

### Dal Tadka

![Dal Tadka](images/dal_tadka.png)

Dal Tadka
**Description:** Dal Tadka is the everyday lentil—toor or masoor dal tempered with ghee, cumin, garlic, and dried red chili. The tempering (tadka) is added at the end, sizzling and fragrant. It's simpler than dal makhani but no less satisfying. The kind of dish that forms the backbone of home cooking. We make ours with a balance that lets the lentils shine while the tadka adds aroma.

The consistency should be neither too thick nor too watery—we aim for something that coats a spoon but isn't paste-like. The tadka is the soul of the dish—the cumin should toast but not burn, the garlic should be golden, and the whole thing should sizzle when poured over the dal. Served with rice or roti, it's a complete protein meal. Vegetarian, gluten-free, and the kind of comfort food that never gets old.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild
**Ingredients:** Toor dal, ghee, cumin, garlic, dried red chili, turmeric

### Kadai Paneer

![Kadai Paneer](images/kadai_paneer.png)

Kadai Paneer
**Description:** Kadai Paneer is paneer in the same wok-style preparation as kadai chicken—cubes of paneer with bell peppers and onions in a coarse masala gravy. The texture is different from butter paneer—more rustic, with the vegetables adding crunch. The kadai masala—roasted coriander and chili—gives it character. For paneer lovers who want something with more punch.

The vegetables should retain some bite—we cook them quickly at high heat. The tomato gravy is thicker than other paneer preparations, and the coarsely ground spices are visible, adding to the rustic appeal. We sometimes add a touch of cream to balance the heat, but it's optional. Served with naan or roti, it's a satisfying vegetarian main that's full of texture and flavor.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Medium
**Ingredients:** Paneer, bell peppers, onions, kadai masala, tomatoes, coriander

### Matar Paneer

![Matar Paneer](images/matar_paneer.png)

Matar Paneer
**Description:** Matar Paneer pairs paneer with green peas in a tomato-based gravy. The sweetness of the peas complements the paneer; the gravy is typically milder than kadai or butter preparations. It's a classic North Indian combination that has stood the test of time. We use fresh peas when in season, frozen otherwise. Simple, satisfying, timeless.

The gravy should be medium-thick, with enough body to coat the paneer and peas. The peas should be cooked but not mushy. Some versions include cream; ours is lighter, with the tomato and onion forming the base. A sprinkle of garam masala at the end adds warmth. Served with roti or rice, it's a comforting vegetarian meal that appeals to all ages.

### Baingan Bharta

![Baingan Bharta](images/baingan_bharta.png)

Baingan Bharta
**Description:** Baingan Bharta is smoked eggplant mashed and cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices. The eggplant is traditionally roasted over an open flame until the skin chars, giving it a smoky depth. We replicate that with careful roasting. The result is earthy, creamy, and deeply satisfying. Served with roti, it's a vegetarian staple that rewards the patient.

The key is the roasting—the eggplant should be completely soft and the skin should char. The flesh is then mashed and cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices. The smokiness from the charring is essential; it's what distinguishes bharta from other eggplant preparations. A touch of cream can be added for richness, but it's optional. Vegetarian, naturally gluten-free, and full of flavor.

### Aloo Gobi

![Aloo Gobi](images/aloo_gobi.png)

Aloo Gobi
**Description:** Aloo Gobi is potatoes and cauliflower stir-fried with spices—dry or with a light gravy. The vegetables should retain some texture; the spices should be warm rather than hot. It's a weeknight staple that scales beautifully. We make ours with a touch of turmeric for color and amchur for tang. Simple, vegan-friendly, perfect.

The key is not overcooking the vegetables—they should be tender but not mushy. The spices are simple: turmeric, cumin, coriander, and perhaps a pinch of garam masala. Some versions are completely dry; ours has a light coating of spices. Served with roti or paratha, it's comfort food that's also healthy. Vegetarian, gluten-free, and a dish that proves simplicity can be delicious.

### Bhindi Masala

![Bhindi Masala](images/bhindi_masala.png)

Bhindi Masala
**Description:** Bhindi Masala celebrates the humble okra—sliced and stir-fried with onions, tomatoes, and spices until the natural mucilage has cooked off and the pods are tender with slight crispness at the edges. The key to great bhindi is preventing sliminess; we achieve this through high-heat cooking and avoiding covering the pan during the critical early stages. The masala—a blend of coriander, cumin, and amchur—adds depth and a hint of tang.

Okra is a nutritional powerhouse, rich in fiber and vitamins. Our version lets the vegetable shine while the spices provide support. It's typically a side dish but substantial enough to be a main with roti for those who prefer lighter meals. Vegetarian, gluten-free, and surprisingly satisfying. Those who thought they didn't like okra often change their minds after trying our bhindi masala.

![Mixed Veg Curry](images/mixed_veg_curry.png)

Mixed Veg Curry
**Description:** Mixed Veg Curry is the versatile vegetarian option—seasonal vegetables in a spiced tomato-onion gravy. Potatoes, carrots, beans, peas, and cauliflower are common; we use what's fresh. The gravy is medium-thick, well-spiced, and satisfying. It's the kind of dish that pleases everyone—substantial enough for a main, familiar enough for the cautious.

The vegetables should be cooked until tender but not mushy, and the gravy should be thick enough to coat them. We use a standard North Indian masala base—onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and spices. It's not fancy, but it's the kind of home-style dish that satisfies. Vegetarian, and can be made vegan by omitting any cream. Served with roti or rice, it's a complete meal.

### Paneer Bhurji

![Paneer Bhurji](images/paneer_bhurji.png)

Paneer Bhurji
**Description:** Paneer Bhurji is scrambled paneer—crumbled cottage cheese stir-fried with onions, tomatoes, and spices. It's quicker to make than most paneer dishes and has a different texture—lighter, more granular. Served with paratha or roti, it's a breakfast or brunch favorite. The kind of dish that comes together in minutes but satisfies completely.

The paneer is crumbled and cooked with onions, tomatoes, and spices until everything melds together. Some versions include bell peppers or peas for extra texture. We keep ours simple, letting the paneer be the star. It's often compared to scrambled eggs in texture, making it a familiar entry point for those new to paneer. Vegetarian, protein-rich, and versatile.

## Non-Vegetarian Curries

### Chicken Tikka Masala

![Chicken Tikka Masala](images/chicken_tikka_masala.png)
**Description:** Chicken Tikka Masala is the British-Indian hybrid that conquered the world—tandoori chicken tikka (boneless pieces) in a spiced tomato-cream gravy. The dish was likely invented in Britain by Indian chefs adapting to local tastes, but it's become a global phenomenon. The gravy is similar to butter chicken but often includes additional spices and sometimes a touch of sweetness. It's approachable, satisfying, and universally loved.

We make our tikka fresh in the tandoor, ensuring the chicken has that characteristic char. The gravy is rich but not heavy, with a balance of tomato, cream, and spices. Served with naan or rice, it's a reliable choice that pleases everyone. The dish has inspired countless variations; ours stays true to the classic while using quality ingredients.

### Mutton Curry

![Mutton Curry](images/mutton_curry.png)

Mutton Curry
**Description:** Mutton Curry is the hearty, no-frills preparation that defines home-style Indian cooking—goat meat (or lamb) in a robust, onion-tomato based gravy. The spices are straightforward: turmeric, coriander, cumin, and garam masala. The meat is slow-cooked until tender, and the gravy reduces to a thick, flavorful coating. It's the kind of dish that evokes Sunday lunches and family gatherings.

We use younger goat for tenderness and cook it until it falls off the bone. The gravy is medium-thick—enough to coat the meat and mix with rice. We don't shy away from the bone-in cuts; connoisseurs know they add flavor. Served with rice or roti, it's comfort food at its finest. Not fancy, but deeply satisfying.

### Egg Curry

![Egg Curry](images/egg_curry.png)

Egg Curry
**Description:** Egg Curry is the humble hero of Indian home cooking—hard-boiled eggs in a spiced gravy. The eggs are often lightly fried before being added to the curry, creating a slightly crisp exterior. The gravy can be tomato-based (North Indian style) or coconut-based (South Indian style); we offer both. It's protein-rich, economical, and deeply satisfying. A staple for vegetarians who eat eggs.

We use farm-fresh eggs and cook them until the yolks are just set. The gravy is well-spiced but not overwhelming—the egg should shine. Served with rice or roti, it's a complete meal that comes together quickly. It's the kind of dish that every Indian has a memory of—perhaps from a hurried weekday dinner or a lazy Sunday lunch.

### Fish Fry

![Fish Fry](images/fish_fry.png)

Fish Fry
**Description:** Fish Fry is coast-inspired—fish fillets marinated in spices, coated in semolina or breadcrumbs, and pan-fried until crisp. We use pomfret, surmai, or basa depending on availability. The marinade includes turmeric, red chili, and perhaps a hint of souring agent. Served with lemon and onion, it's the kind of dish that doesn't need accompaniment. Crisp, flavorful, satisfying.

The key is the marinade—it should penetrate the fish without overwhelming its natural flavor. The coating should be thin and crisp, not heavy. We pan-fry rather than deep-fry for a lighter result. The fish should be flaky and moist inside. Served with a squeeze of lemon and perhaps some tartar sauce, it's a seafood lover's delight. Perfect with rice or as a standalone dish.

### Prawn Curry

![Prawn Curry](images/prawn_curry.png)

Prawn Curry
**Description:** Prawn Curry brings the coast to your table—prawns in a coconut-based gravy (South Indian style) or tomato-based (North Indian style). We offer both. The prawns should be tender, the gravy rich and fragrant. Coconut adds sweetness; spices add warmth. Served with rice, it's a taste of the sea. For seafood lovers who want something beyond fried preparations.

The prawns should be cooked just right—overcooked and they become rubbery. We add them at the end so they don't overcook. The gravy is the star—coconut milk, spices, and perhaps a touch of tamarind for tang. The South Indian version is milder and creamier; the North Indian version has more tomato and is spicier. Both are delicious. A coastal delicacy.

### Chicken Do Pyaza

![Chicken Do Pyaza](images/chicken_do_pyaza.png)

Chicken Do Pyaza
**Description:** Chicken Do Pyaza applies the same double-onion treatment to chicken—tender pieces in a gravy rich with caramelized onions. The sweetness of the onions balances the heat of the spices. It's milder than many chicken curries, making it approachable for those new to Indian food. A classic that deserves more attention.

The "do pyaza" refers to onions being used twice—once in the gravy and once added later for texture. The result is a curry that's sweeter and more aromatic than standard preparations. The chicken should be tender, and the gravy should be thick enough to coat each piece. Served with naan or rice, it's a satisfying meal that showcases the humble onion.

## Rice & Breads

### Veg Biryani

![Veg Biryani](images/veg_biryani.png)
**Description:** Veg Biryani proves that biryani doesn't need meat to be magnificent—layers of fragrant basmati rice and spiced vegetables, cooked together on dum. The vegetables typically include potatoes, carrots, beans, and peas; sometimes paneer or soya chunks for protein. The rice is parboiled with whole spices; the vegetable layer is richly spiced. The result is aromatic, colorful, and satisfying.

We use seasonal vegetables and a biryani masala that we've developed specifically for the veg version. The potato—often the star—is cooked until it absorbs the spices. Served with raita, it's a complete meal. Vegetarians who've felt left out of the biryani experience need look no further. It's hearty enough to satisfy even carnivores.

### Jeera Rice

![Jeera Rice](images/jeera_rice.png)

Jeera Rice
**Description:** Jeera Rice is the aromatic backbone of many Indian meals—basmati rice tempered with cumin seeds (jeera) in ghee or oil. The cumin toasts as the rice cooks, infusing every grain with its distinctive warm, slightly nutty flavor. It's the perfect accompaniment to rich curries—absorbing gravy without competing for attention. Simple, elegant, and endlessly versatile.

We use aged basmati for its long grains and fragrance. The proportion of cumin to rice is crucial—too little and it's bland; too much and it overwhelms. A touch of salt and perhaps a bay leaf complete the dish. It's vegetarian, gluten-free, and the kind of preparation that seems simple until you try to replicate it at home. A staple on our rice menu.

### Garlic Naan

![Garlic Naan](images/garlic_naan.png)

Garlic Naan
**Description:** Garlic Naan takes the standard naan and adds minced garlic—either mixed into the dough or brushed on after baking. The garlic toasts slightly, adding aroma and flavor without overwhelming. It's the naan of choice for those who want something with more character than plain. Perfect with rich curries where the garlic can stand up to the spices.

We're generous with the garlic—we're not shy. The naan is baked in the tandoor like the standard version, with the garlic added at the right moment to toast without burning. It's vegetarian and the kind of bread that makes you order extra. One garlic naan is never enough when the curry is good.

**Category:** North Indian | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild
**Ingredients:** Flour, yogurt, garlic, yeast

### Roti

![Roti](images/roti.png)

Roti
**Description:** Roti is the everyday bread of North India—whole wheat flatbread cooked on a tawa (griddle) until it puffs. No yeast, no maida—just whole wheat flour, water, and salt. It's healthier than naan, lighter, and the perfect vehicle for curries and dals. The technique of getting it to puff requires practice; we've mastered it. Each roti should be soft, pliable, and slightly charred in spots.

We make ours fresh to order when possible. It's vegetarian, vegan (we use no ghee in the basic version), and the kind of bread that forms the backbone of North Indian meals. For those watching their refined flour intake, it's the preferred choice. Simple, essential, perfect.

## Street Food

### Bhel Puri

![Bhel Puri](images/bhel_puri.png)

Bhel Puri
**Description:** Bhel Puri is Mumbai's beloved crunchy snack—puffed rice, sev, chopped vegetables, and chutneys mixed together just before serving. The key is the timing: mix it too early and it gets soggy; serve it too late and the flavors haven't melded. We get it right—each bite offers crisp puffed rice, the crunch of sev, the freshness of onions and tomato, and the tang of tamarind and the heat of green chutney.

We offer the classic version as well as variations—add papdi for extra crunch, or mango for sweetness in season. It's vegetarian, relatively light (despite the fried elements), and the perfect beach snack—though we've seen it enjoyed everywhere. A squeeze of lemon at the end is essential. Mumbai on a plate.

### Dahi Puri

![Dahi Puri](images/dahi_puri.png)

Dahi Puri
**Description:** Dahi Puri takes the pani puri concept and adds yogurt—hollow puris filled with potato and chickpea mixture, then topped with yogurt, chutneys, and sev. The yogurt adds a cooling creaminess that balances the tang and spice. Like pani puri, they're meant to be eaten in one or two bites, but the experience is different—less explosive, more creamy. A popular choice for those who find pani puri too intense.

We fill our puris to order and top them generously with yogurt. The tamarind and mint chutneys add the characteristic sweet-tangy notes. A dusting of chaat masala and red chili powder completes the dish. It's vegetarian and a great introduction to chaat for the uninitiated. Six pieces per order is standard; we've had requests for double.

### Vada Pav

![Vada Pav](images/vada_pav.png)

Vada Pav
**Description:** Vada Pav is Mumbai's answer to the burger—a potato fritter (vada) sandwiched in a pav (bread roll) with chutneys and perhaps a green chili. The vada is made from spiced mashed potato coated in chickpea flour batter and deep-fried. The pav is typically toasted with butter. The combination is carb-heavy, indulgent, and utterly addictive. It's been called the poor man's burger; we prefer to think of it as the people's burger.

We make our vada fresh, ensuring a crisp exterior and fluffy interior. The chutneys—typically a green coriander-chili and a red garlic-chili—add layers of flavor. Some add a dry garlic chutney for extra punch. It's vegetarian, cheap, and the kind of food that fuels a city. One is a snack; two is a meal. Mumbai's soul in a bun.

### Aloo Tikki

![Aloo Tikki](images/aloo_tikki.png)

Aloo Tikki
**Description:** Aloo Tikki are spiced potato patties—mashed potatoes mixed with aromatics, shaped into discs, and pan-fried until golden. They're crunchier than the vada in vada pav, with a softer interior. Served with chutneys and perhaps chickpeas, they're a versatile snack that works as an appetizer or a light meal. The simplicity of the ingredients belies the skill required to achieve the right texture—crisp outside, fluffy inside.

We season ours with cumin, coriander, and a hint of amchur. The tikkis are fried in minimal oil for a lighter result. We offer them as a standalone snack or as part of a chaat (topped with yogurt, chutneys, and sev). Vegetarian and gluten-free when made without binding agents. A crowd-pleaser for all ages.

### Chole Kulche

![Chole Kulche](images/chole_kulche.png)

Chole Kulche
**Description:** Chole Kulche is Delhi's beloved combination—spiced chickpeas (chole) served with kulcha, a leavened flatbread that's typically baked in a tandoor. The kulcha is softer and fluffier than naan, often stuffed with onions or paneer. The chole is the same preparation as in chole bhature, but the kulcha provides a different experience—lighter, less greasy than the fried bhature. Together, they're a match made in North Indian heaven.

We serve our chole with a slightly thicker gravy for the kulcha—it needs to be substantial enough to scoop. The kulcha is brushed with butter and served hot. It's vegetarian, filling, and the kind of combination that satisfies at any time of day. A squeeze of lemon and some raw onion complete the experience. Simpler than chole bhature, but no less delicious.

### Papdi Chaat

![Papdi Chaat](images/papdi_chaat.png)

Papdi Chaat
**Description:** Papdi Chaat is the crunchy, tangy, sweet assemblage that defines North Indian street food—crisp flour discs (papdi) topped with boiled potatoes, chickpeas, yogurt, tamarind chutney, mint chutney, and a dusting of chaat masala. The result is a riot of textures and flavors in every bite. Each component plays a role: the papdi provides crunch, the yogurt cools, the chutneys add tang and sweetness, the chaat masala brings the umami.

We assemble ours to order so the papdi stays crisp. The balance of sweet and tangy is crucial—we've perfected our chutney ratios. It's vegetarian, endlessly customizable (add sev for extra crunch, or pomegranate for sweetness), and the kind of dish that makes you understand why chaat has such a devoted following. Shareable, but you might not want to.

**Category:** Street Food | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild-Medium

### Sev Puri

![Sev Puri](images/sev_puri.png)

Sev Puri
**Description:** Sev Puri is another chaat variation—flat puris topped with potatoes, chickpeas, chutneys, yogurt, and a generous mound of sev. It's eaten with the hands; the puris provide a base. The combination of crisp, soft, tangy, and crunchy is addictive. We assemble to order so the puris stay crisp. A Mumbai street food star.

Each puri is topped individually, creating bite-sized portions that explode with flavor. The sev adds the final crunchy layer. The yogurt balances the heat from the green chutney, while the tamarind chutney adds sweetness. A sprinkle of chaat masala ties everything together. It's vegetarian, fun to eat, and perfect for sharing—though you might not want to.

**Category:** Street Food | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild-Medium

### Ragda Pattice

![Ragda Pattice](images/ragda_pattice.png)

Ragda Pattice
**Description:** Ragda Pattice pairs white pea curry (ragda) with potato patties (pattice)—a Mumbai street food classic. The ragda is mild and comforting; the pattice are crisp outside, soft inside. Topped with chutneys, onions, and sev, it's a complete meal. The kind of dish that rewards the adventurous. Vegetarian and deeply satisfying.

The ragda is made from dried white peas cooked until soft in a mildly spiced gravy. The pattice are similar to aloo tikki but often include peas in the filling. The combination of the soft ragda and crispy pattice creates a textural contrast that's delightful. The chutneys and toppings add layers of flavor. It's hearty, filling, and one of Mumbai's best-kept secrets.

**Category:** Street Food | **Type:** Vegetarian | **Spice Level:** Mild-Medium

## Rolls

### Paneer Tikka Roll

![Paneer Tikka Roll](images/paneer_tikka_roll.png)

Paneer Tikka Roll
**Description:** Paneer Tikka Roll wraps our tandoori paneer tikka in a paratha or rumali roti with chutneys and onions. It's the vegetarian answer to the kathi roll—portable, flavorful, and satisfying. The paneer is warm and smokey; the bread is soft and pliable. Perfect for a quick lunch or a light dinner. The kind of wrap that converts skeptics.

The paneer is marinated and grilled in the tandoor, giving it that characteristic smoky flavor. The bread is warmed and spread with chutneys—mint and sometimes tamarind. Onions and perhaps some lettuce add freshness. It's wrapped tightly and served hot. Vegetarian and substantial enough to be a meal. One of our most popular items.

### Chicken Kathi Roll

![Chicken Kathi Roll](images/chicken_kathi_roll.png)

Chicken Kathi Roll
**Description:** Chicken Kathi Roll is Kolkata's gift—tandoori chicken wrapped in paratha with chutneys, onions, and perhaps an egg. The chicken is marinated and grilled; the paratha is flaky and rich. It's handheld perfection. We make ours with attention to the balance—the chicken shouldn't be overwhelmed by the bread. A meal in a roll.

The Kathi roll was invented in Kolkata and has since spread across India. The key is the quality of the chicken—it should be tender and flavorful. The paratha is often egg-coated for extra richness. The chutneys and onions add freshness and tang. It's wrapped tightly in paper, making it perfect for eating on the go. A street food icon.

### Egg Roll

![Egg Roll](images/egg_roll.png)

Egg Roll
**Description:** Egg Roll wraps a paratha around an omelette with onions and chutneys. It's the most economical of the rolls but no less satisfying. The egg adds protein; the paratha adds heft. It's the kind of street food that fuels students and office workers. Simple, cheap, delicious. The Indian answer to the breakfast burrito.

The paratha is rolled thin and cooked on a griddle. An egg is beaten and poured over the paratha, which is then flipped to cook the egg. Onions and chutneys are added, and the whole thing is rolled up. It's served hot, wrapped in paper. Vegetarian (in the sense that it contains eggs), filling, and the kind of food that hits the spot. A Kolkata staple.

## Gujarati

### Dhokla

![Dhokla](images/dhokla.png)

Dhokla
**Description:** Dhokla is Gujarat's steamed delicacy—fermented rice and chickpea batter steamed until spongy, then tempered with mustard seeds and curry leaves. It's light, fluffy, and surprisingly healthy. Served with chutney, it's a snack or light meal. The fermentation gives it a slight tang. Vegetarian, gluten-free when made with the right grains, and utterly addictive.

The key is the fermentation and steaming—the dhokla should be airy and spongy, not dense. The tempering adds a burst of flavor. We cut ours into diamond shapes and garnish with fresh coriander and grated coconut. It's typically served with green chutney. Dhokla is protein-rich, low in fat, and the kind of snack that's both delicious and nutritious.

Thepla
**Description:** Thepla is Gujarati flatbread—whole wheat with fenugreek leaves (methi), spices, and sometimes yogurt. It's typically thinner than paratha and has a longer shelf life—travel food for Gujaratis. We serve ours fresh with pickle and yogurt. It's vegetarian and the kind of bread that pairs with everything. A Gujarati staple.

The fenugreek leaves add a distinctive flavor—slightly bitter but pleasant. The dough is spiced with turmeric, chili, and coriander. The theplas are rolled thin and cooked on a griddle. They can be eaten hot or at room temperature. Gujaratis often pack them for journeys—they keep well and are satisfying. We serve them fresh, but they're also available as a takeaway item.

Served with croutons or a grilled cheese sandwich, it's nostalgia in a bowl. Vegetarian and the kind of soup that pleases everyone. Simple, satisfying, timeless.

The key is using quality tomatoes and not over-seasoning. We roast our tomatoes for depth before blending. The cream is optional—some prefer it without. A swirl of cream and a sprinkle of black pepper complete the bowl. It's the kind of soup that warms you on a cold day or starts a meal on the right note. Universal appeal.

The mushrooms are sautéed with garlic and onions before being blended with cream and broth. The result is deeply flavorful—umami-rich from the mushrooms.

It's the kind of soup your grandmother would approve of—nourishing, mild, and restorative. We use bone-in chicken for extra flavor when possible. Perfect for when you're under the weather or want something light.

The broth is simmered for hours to extract maximum flavor. We add vegetables like carrots, celery, and perhaps some noodles. The chicken should be tender and easily pulled apart. It's the kind of soup that makes you feel better. Simple, honest, and deeply satisfying. A universal comfort food.

The kind of soup that appeals to children and those seeking something familiar. We make ours with fresh corn when in season. Vegetarian version available. A gentle start to a meal.

The soup is thickened with cornstarch, giving it a velvety texture. The corn provides natural sweetness. We add a touch of black pepper and sometimes a swirl of egg for richness.

### Raita

![Raita](images/raita.png)

Raita
**Description:** Raita is the cooling counterpart to spicy Indian food—yogurt thinned with water or milk, mixed with chopped cucumber, tomato, onion, or grated carrot, and seasoned with cumin, salt, and sometimes a touch of mint. It serves multiple purposes: tempering heat, aiding digestion, and adding a refreshing element to rich meals. No thali or biryani is complete without it.

We make our raita fresh, using thick yogurt as the base. The vegetable ratio varies—some prefer it chunky, others smoother. A tempering of roasted cumin powder is essential. We offer plain, cucumber, and mixed vegetable versions. It's vegetarian, probiotic-rich, and the perfect palate cleanser between bites of biryani or curry. Cool, creamy, and essential.

### Green Salad

![Green Salad](images/green_salad.png)

Green Salad
**Description:** Green Salad is the simple option—mixed lettuce with cucumber, tomato, and perhaps carrot, dressed with vinaigrette or lemon-olive oil. It's the kind of salad that goes with everything. We use fresh greens and a light hand with the dressing. Vegetarian and the perfect side when you want something fresh. Customization available—add cheese, nuts, or protein.

The key is fresh ingredients—crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and crunchy cucumber. The dressing is kept light so it doesn't overwhelm. We offer it as a side or as a larger salad that can be a meal. It's the kind of dish that adds freshness to any plate. Simple, healthy, and universally appealing.

### Papad

![Papad](images/papad.png)

Papad
**Description:** Papad (or Papadum) is the crispy, thin disc made from lentil, chickpea, or rice flour—a staple accompaniment to Indian meals. The papad can be roasted over an open flame until it puffs and crisps, or deep-fried for extra crunch. The flavor varies depending on the base—some are spiced with black pepper and cumin, others are plain. Each bite adds a satisfying crunch to your meal.

We offer both roasted and fried versions. The roasted papad is lighter and has a more pronounced flavor from the flame. The fried version is richer and crunchier. Papad is vegetarian, gluten-free (when made from lentil or chickpea flour), and the kind of side that makes every meal better. Perfect for scooping up dal or curry, or simply eaten on its own as a crunchy snack.

## Indian Sweets

### Kheer

![Kheer](images/kheer.png)

Kheer
**Description:** Kheer is Indian rice pudding—rice slow-cooked in milk until the grains break down and the mixture thickens, sweetened with sugar and scented with cardamom and saffron. Nuts and raisins are often added for texture. It's served cold or at room temperature, often at festivals and celebrations. The texture should be creamy and porridge-like; the rice should be soft but not completely dissolved.

We use full-fat milk for creaminess and basmati rice for its fragrance. The cardamom is added at the end to preserve its aroma. A garnish of slivered almonds and pistachios adds visual appeal and crunch. It's vegetarian, gluten-free, and one of India's most beloved desserts. The simplicity of the ingredients belies the skill required to achieve the perfect consistency.

### Ras Malai

![Ras Malai](images/ras_malai.png)
**Description:** Ras Malai are soft, spongy discs of paneer soaked in sweetened, flavored milk (rabri). The paneer is made from milk, shaped into discs, and cooked in sugar syrup before being cooled and transferred to the reduced, cardamom-scented milk. The result is impossibly light—the discs absorb the milk like sponges, becoming melt-in-your-mouth soft. It's a Bengali origin dessert that has conquered India.

We make our ras malai from scratch—the paneer discs are fresh, and the milk is reduced slowly for maximum richness. Saffron and cardamom scent the milk; pistachios add garnish. Each piece should be chilled and served with a spoonful of the reduced milk. It's rich—two pieces are usually sufficient—but utterly worth the indulgence. A festival favorite.

### Gajar Ka Halwa

![Gajar Ka Halwa](images/gajar_ka_halwa.png)

Gajar Ka Halwa
**Description:** Gajar Ka Halwa is winter's sweetest gift—carrots slow-cooked in milk and ghee until they caramelize and achieve a fudge-like consistency. Sugar (or condensed milk) adds sweetness; cardamom and nuts add complexity. The dish is traditionally made when carrots are in season—winter in North India—and the red carrots of that season are considered superior. The color ranges from orange to deep red depending on the carrots used.

We grate our carrots by hand for the right texture and cook them slowly, stirring constantly to prevent burning. The ghee is added in stages, and the milk is allowed to reduce completely. The result is intensely carroty, sweet but not cloying. Served warm with a scoop of ice cream or as is, it's comfort in a bowl. Vegetarian and gluten-free.

### Kulfi

![Kulfi](images/kulfi.png)
**Description:** Kulfi is Indian ice cream—dense, rich, and traditionally made by reducing milk slowly until it thickens, then freezing it in conical molds. Unlike Western ice cream, it's not churned, so it has a denser, creamier texture. Flavors include malai (plain), pistachio, mango, and rose. The pistachio version, with its distinctive green hue and nutty flavor, is perhaps the most iconic.

We offer traditional flavors as well as seasonal specials. The kulfi is served frozen, often on a stick or sliced. It melts slowly, allowing you to savor each bite. It's richer than regular ice cream—a single serving is substantial. Vegetarian and a perfect dessert for hot Indian summers. The malai kulfi with falooda (vermicelli and rose syrup) is a classic combination.

### Rasgulla

![Rasgulla](images/rasgulla.png)

Rasgulla
**Description:** Rasgulla are soft, spongy balls of fresh paneer cooked in sugar syrup. Unlike ras malai, they're served in the syrup itself—light, sweet, and surprisingly refreshing. The paneer balls are shaped and cooked in the syrup, which they absorb, becoming soft and delicate. They're a Bengali invention that has become pan-Indian, often served at celebrations and as a sweet ending to meals.

We source our rasgulla from trusted makers who use the traditional method. The balls should be uniform in size, soft without being mushy, and the syrup should be light and not overly sweet. Served chilled, they're a refreshing dessert. Vegetarian and a favorite among those who prefer lighter sweets. Two or three per serving is typical.

### Kaju Katli

![Kaju Katli](images/kaju_katli.png)

Kaju Katli
**Description:** Kaju Katli is cashew fudge—ground cashews with sugar, shaped into diamond slices. It's rich, melt-in-the-mouth, and a Diwali staple. The quality of the cashews matters; we use the best. It's vegetarian and the kind of sweet that signals celebration. Elegant, delicious, and impossible to eat just one piece.

The cashews are ground to a fine powder and cooked with sugar until the mixture reaches the right consistency. It's then rolled thin and cut into diamonds while still warm. The result is silky smooth, not grainy. A silver leaf (varak) is sometimes applied for special occasions. It's the sweet you give as a gift, the sweet you serve at festivals. Premium quality, premium taste.

### Besan Ladoo

![Besan Ladoo](images/besan_ladoo.png)

Besan Ladoo
**Description:** Besan Ladoo are round sweets made from roasted gram flour, ghee, and sugar. The roasting gives the besan a nutty flavor; the ghee adds richness. They're a North Indian festival favorite. We make ours with attention to the roasting—underdone and they taste raw; overdone and they're bitter. The sweet spot is golden and fragrant.

The besan is roasted in ghee until it turns golden and fragrant. Sugar is added once it cools slightly, and the mixture is shaped into balls while still warm. Nuts and cardamom are often added for extra flavor. They're slightly crumbly but hold together well. Vegetarian and the kind of sweet that's made at home for festivals. Ours taste homemade because we follow traditional methods.

### Falooda

Falooda
**Description:** Falooda is the rose-scented dessert drink—vermicelli, basil seeds, and rose syrup in milk, often topped with ice cream. It's Mughlai in origin, Persian in inspiration. The textures are key—the slippery vermicelli, the gelatinous basil seeds, the sweet rose. We make ours with quality ingredients. Vegetarian and a showstopper. Perfect for sharing or solo indulgence.

The vermicelli is cooked and cooled, the basil seeds are soaked until they swell. Everything is layered in a glass with rose syrup and milk, then topped with ice cream and nuts. It's colorful, textured, and unlike anything else. The rose syrup provides the signature pink color and floral flavor. It's a dessert and a drink in one. Perfect for hot summer days.

### Brownie with Ice Cream

![Brownie with Ice Cream](images/brownie_with_ice_cream.png)

Brownie with Ice Cream
**Description:** Brownie with Ice Cream is the dessert that needs no introduction—a warm, fudgy brownie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The contrast of hot and cold, the way the ice cream melts into the brownie—it's perfection. We make our brownies in-house, ensuring they're dense and chocolatey rather than cake-like. The ice cream is a quality vanilla that doesn't compete with the chocolate.

We offer a single brownie or a larger portion for sharing. A drizzle of chocolate sauce or caramel can take it over the top. It's vegetarian and the kind of dessert that ends a meal on a high note. Simple, satisfying, and universally loved. Sometimes the classics are the best.

Cheesecake
**Description:** Cheesecake is the rich, creamy dessert that divides opinion—dense or light? Baked or set? We offer a New York-style baked cheesecake: dense, rich, with a graham cracker crust. The top might have a slight crack; that's authenticity. We serve it plain or with fruit compote (strawberry, blueberry) or chocolate. A slice is substantial—this is dessert for the committed.

We make ours with cream cheese, which gives it the characteristic tang and density. The crust provides textural contrast. It's vegetarian (we use gelatin-free alternatives when possible). Served chilled, it's the kind of dessert that demands a pause before the next bite. For cheesecake lovers, it's non-negotiable.

**Description:** Ice Cream Sundae is build-your-own dessert—scoops of ice cream (we offer vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and others) topped with your choice of sauces, nuts, and whipped cream. The classic is vanilla with chocolate sauce and a cherry, but we encourage customization. Banana splits, hot fudge sundaes—we do it all. It's the dessert that lets you have exactly what you want.

### Masala Chai

Masala Chai
**Description:** Masala Chai is India's gift to the world—black tea brewed with milk and a blend of spices including cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and black pepper. The "masala" varies by region and household; we use a balanced blend that highlights the ginger and cardamom. The tea is typically brewed strong, then mixed with milk and sugar. Served in small glasses, it's the perfect accompaniment to conversation or a snack.

We make our chai fresh, boiling the tea and spices together before adding milk. The result is bold, aromatic, and deeply comforting. It's the kind of drink that warms you from the inside—perfect for monsoon evenings or after a heavy meal. We offer it with various milk options and sweetness levels.

It's the simplest of drinks but when made well, utterly satisfying. We use fresh limes and adjust the sweetness to preference. It's vegetarian, vegan, and the kind of drink that quenches thirst like nothing else. A squeeze of lemon at the end is essential. Indian summer in a glass.

Mango Lassi
**Description:** Mango Lassi is the tropical twist on traditional lassi—fresh yogurt blended with mango pulp, water, and sugar until smooth and frothy. It's thick, creamy, and intensely mango. We use seasonal mangoes when available; Alphonso mangoes in season create something that's closer to dessert than drink. The yogurt provides tang that balances the sweetness of the mango.

Mango lassi has become one of the most popular Indian beverages worldwide. It's cooling, refreshing, and pairs beautifully with spicy food. We make ours with full-fat yogurt for maximum creaminess. A sprinkle of cardamom on top adds a subtle aromatic note. It's vegetarian, gluten-free, and the kind of drink that transports you to a mango orchard with every sip. Summer in a glass.
